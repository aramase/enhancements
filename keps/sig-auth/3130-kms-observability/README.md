## Summary

Currently, it is very hard for Kubernetes users to detect envelope encryption failures. They have to go through layers and layers of abstractions before reaching the storage level errors. If they are able to understand that the issue is related to kms encryption, they won't be able to correlate (in logs) the sequence of calls that are involved in the enveloping operation: kube-apiserver->kms-plugin->KMS, so they won't be able to understand the cause of the failures they are seeing. This KEP proposes to add new metrics to the kube-apiserver and extend the signature of the kms-plugin interface to include the transaction ID (to be generated by the kube-apiserver), which kms-plugin could pass to KMS.

## Motivation

There aren't any way today to easily detect envelope encryption errors without going through the kube-apiserver logs. Also, the only way to correlate a successful/failed envelope operation today is to use the approximate timestamp of the operation to check events in kube-apiserver, kms-plugin and KMS. There is no guarantee that the timestamp of the operation is the same as the timestamp of the corresponding event in KMS. This KEP proposes extending the signature of the kms-plugin interface to include the transaction ID (to be generated by the kube-apiserver), which kms-plugin could pass to KMS. This transaction ID will be logged with additional metadata such a secret name and namespace for the envelope operation. Similarly, the transaction ID will be logged in the kms-plugin and optionally passed to KMS.

### Goals

- Add metrics to kube-apiserver about envelope encryption operations
- Add transaction ID to kms-plugin interface
- Update the logging in kube-apiserver to include transaction ID and non-sensitive metadata such as secret name, namespace for envelope operations

### Non-Goals

- Using this transaction ID for audit logging

## Proposal

- Add kube-apiserver metrics about envelope encryption/decryption operations.
- Generate a new UID for each envelope operation in kube-apiserver.
- Add a new UID field to the envelope operation in kms-plugin interface.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

The most valuable metrics that we could get at the kube-apiserver are level about the result of the encryption and decryption operations. Exposing metrics that would allow computing error rates of the envelope operations would make it possible to narrow down the potential cause of the failures. As such to improve kms monitoring, the following metrics will be added:
```
apiserver_storage_envelope_encryptions_total
apiserver_storage_envelope_encryptions_failure_total
apiserver_storage_envelope_decryptions_total
apiserver_storage_envelope_decryptions_failure_total
```

The log design is centered around generating a new UID for each envelope operation similar to UID generation in admission review requests here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/e9e669aa6037c380469b45200e59cff9b52d6d68/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/plugin/webhook/request/admissionreview.go#L137.

A new field will be added to the `EncryptRequest` and `DecryptRequest` structs in the kms-plugin interface.

```go
type EncryptRequest struct {
	// UID is a unique identifier for the request.
	UID string `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=uid,proto3" json:"uid,omitempty"`
	// Version of the KMS plugin API.
	Version string `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=version,proto3" json:"version,omitempty"`
	// The data to be encrypted.
	Plain                []byte   `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=plain,proto3" json:"plain,omitempty"`
	XXX_NoUnkeyedLiteral struct{} `json:"-"`
	XXX_unrecognized     []byte   `json:"-"`
	XXX_sizecache        int32    `json:"-"`
}
```

```go
type DecryptRequest struct {
	// UID is a unique identifier for the request.
	UID string `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=uid,proto3" json:"uid,omitempty"`
	// Version of the KMS plugin API.
	Version string `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=version,proto3" json:"version,omitempty"`
	// The data to be decrypted.
	Cipher               []byte   `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=cipher,proto3" json:"cipher,omitempty"`
	XXX_NoUnkeyedLiteral struct{} `json:"-"`
	XXX_unrecognized     []byte   `json:"-"`
	XXX_sizecache        int32    `json:"-"`
}
```

The UID generated in the kube-apiserver will be used:

1. For logging in the kube-apiserver. All envelope operations to the kms-plugin will be logged with the corresponding UID.
   1. The UID will be logged using a wrapper in the kube-apiserver to ensure that the UID is logged in the same format and is always logged.
   2. In addition to the UID, the kube-apiserver will also log non-sensitive metadata such as name, namespace and GroupVersionResource of the object that triggered the envelope operation.
2. Sent to the kms-plugin as part of the `EncryptRequest` and `DecryptRequest` structs.

### Test Plan

Unit tests covering:

1. Generation of UID for each envelope operation

Integration test covering:

1. Logging of UID in kube-apiserver
2. UID in the `EncryptRequest` and `DecryptRequest`

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [x] Other
  - Describe the mechanism: The UID field will be added by default to the `EncryptRequest` and `DecryptRequest` structs in the kms-plugin interface. For older Kubernetes versions where UID isn't generated, the UID field will be empty.

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

UID sent as part of the envelope operation is a change in the default behavior. This is backwards compatible.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

The enhancement is centered around better logging for observability and ability to correlate the sequence of calls that are involved in the enveloping operation. It is not possible to roll back the UID generation.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Logs in kube-apiserver, kms-plugin and KMS will be logged with the corresponding UID.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

There should be no impact on the SLO with this change.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

- [x] Metrics:
  - Metric names:
    - apiserver_storage_envelope_encryptions_total
    - apiserver_storage_envelope_encryptions_failure_total
    - apiserver_storage_envelope_decryptions_total
    - apiserver_storage_envelope_decryptions_failure_total
  - Aggregation method: error rates
  - Components exposing the metric: kube-apiserver
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Logs in kube-apiserver, kms-plugin and KMS will be logged with the corresponding UID.

### Dependencies

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

This proposal adds a new field `UID` to the gRPC API for envelope operations.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

- ETCD data encryption with external kms-plugin is unavailable

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available

- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

We considered using the AuditID from the kube-apiserver request that generated the envelope operation. This approach has the following drawbacks:

1. AuditID can be configured by the user with the `Audit-ID` header in the API server request. Multiple requests can be sent to the kube-apiserver with the same Audit-ID.
2. Not all API server requests will generate an envelope operation. The API server caches DEKs and for the DEK that's available in the cache, the kube-apiserver will not generate an envelope operation.
3. Since not all calls to the KMS correspond to an audit log, using audit ID is not complete for correlating calls from kube-apiserver->kms-plugin->KMS.
